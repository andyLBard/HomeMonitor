## This project is under construction, additional modules will be added as work continues.

#### Contents
1) Arduino Code
  * This folder contains sub-folders for each of the arduino-based modules in the project. These currently include the Sump Monitor and the Home Monitor hub. The hub portion of the project is currently designed to require an Arduino mega. The other modules are Arduino uno compatible.   
2) RaspberryPi Code
  * This folder contains the source code for the web monitor component of the project. It provides a lightweight web application for checking sensor status over http.
3) Wiring
  * This folder will soon contain the wiring diagrams for each of the modules.
